Skin Cancer Detection
=====================

Classifying Malignant vs. Benign Skin Lesions using CNN and Transfer Learning

\=====================

Overview
========

* * *

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify skin cancer images as **Malignant** or **Benign**. Two approaches were implemented:

1.  **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** without transfer learning.
2.  **Transfer Learning** using a pre-trained **ResNet50** model.

The project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support dermatologists in early skin cancer detection.

Features
========

* * *

*   **Two Model Approaches**:
    *   A CNN architecture designed from scratch for classification.
    *   Transfer learning using **ResNet50**, fine-tuned for skin cancer image classification.
*   **Image Preprocessing**: Input images resized to a consistent shape, normalized, and augmented to improve model robustness.
*   **Metrics**: High accuracy achieved in distinguishing malignant from benign cases.

CNN Model Architecture (Without Transfer Learning)
==================================================

* * *

The custom CNN model consists of:

1.  **Convolutional Layers**:
    *   Two Conv2D layers with ReLU activation and L2 regularization.
    *   Kernel sizes: 5x5; strides: (1, 1).
2.  **Pooling and Normalization**:
    *   MaxPooling layers with 2x2 pool size and stride of 2.
    *   Batch Normalization for stabilizing learning.
3.  **Dropout**:
    *   Dropout with a rate of 0.4 to prevent overfitting.
4.  **Fully Connected Layers**:
    *   Dense layers with 64, 32 neurons respectively, and ReLU activation.
    *   Final dense layer with 2 neurons and softmax activation for classification.

**Optimizer**: Adam optimizer.  
**Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy.  
**Metrics**: Accuracy.

Transfer Learning Model Architecture (ResNet50)
===============================================

* * *

The transfer learning approach utilizes the **ResNet50** model:

1.  **Pre-trained Backbone**:
    *   ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor.
2.  **Fine-tuning**:
    *   Added custom fully connected layers for the classification task.
    *   Trained on the skin cancer dataset with data augmentation.

**Optimizer**: Adam optimizer.  
**Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy.  
**Metrics**: Accuracy.

Installation
============

* * *

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/skin-cancer-detection.git
    cd skin-cancer-detection
    ```
    
Dataset
=======

* * *

The (dataset).[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign] includes labeled images of skin lesions categorized as **Malignant** or **Benign**. Images were preprocessed by resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model generalization.

Results
=======

* * *

The models achieved promising performance in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions.

*   **CNN (Without Transfer Learning)**: Performance to be optimized further.
*   **Transfer Learning (ResNet50)**: Demonstrated higher accuracy due to pre-trained features.

Detailed evaluation metrics can be found in the `results` folder.

Future Enhancements
===================

* * *

*   Experiment with other pre-trained models like EfficientNet or MobileNet.
*   Collect and integrate additional diverse datasets for better generalization.
*   Deploy the model as a web application for broader accessibility.
